// Want a seperate event listener on each button
// when clicked, the button will be 'highlighted' (lighter color?)
// this triggers the appropriate red or green light
// set a time delay, maybe 2 seconds
// then have the current floor displayed change
// turn off highlighting on button and green/red light


// scroll up and down
// jQuery magic, probs


// make sure the elevator goes to the levels in order that the button was pushed
// have some sort of global list
// add to the list in order that the event listeners are triggered
// when the floor is reached, remove that floor from list
// continue until list is empty
